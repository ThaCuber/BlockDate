# BlockDate
A random tetrimino game made for the Playdate console.

All sounds made with [Dn-Famitracker](https://github.com/Dn-Programming-Core-Management/Dn-FamiTracker) by D.P.C.M (funny chiptune joke)

All assets made by me, apart from the launcher card, which was made by [Dustin Mierau](https://twitter.com/dmierau)
