# BlockDate
A random falling-block game made for the Playdate console.

## Building
Clone or download the repository and call `make`. `make run` to run the game in the simulator. In Windows, call `build.bat`.
You can also use Nova and VS Code. I am however unaware of how their build tools work as I don't use either of them.
